# Calculations in python program will yeild different results. 
# This is due to the laws of precendence. 

# The precedence of Arithmetic Operators in Python is as follows:

# P – Parentheses
# E – Exponentiation
# M – Multiplication (Multiplication and division have the same precedence)
# D – Division
# A – Addition (Addition and subtraction have the same precedence)
# S – Subtraction
# The modulus operator

a = 1 * 2 + 3 * 4
b= 1 * (2 + 3) * 4
print ("Even though the numbers and the operations are in exact order, the results are different due to Laws of precedence")
print ("operation one's result is ", a)
print ("opearation two's result is ", b)
